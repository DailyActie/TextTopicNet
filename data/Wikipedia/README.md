Download and uncompress train and test data of **A New Approach to Cross-Modal Multimedia Retrieval**.

The original datasets can be download from here: http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/crossmodal/wiki_top10cats.tar.gz

Here is a mirror in case the official site is down: https://pjreddie.com/projects/pascal-voc-dataset-mirror/

You'll need the VOC2007 Train/Validation Data (VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar 439 MB) and the 2007 Test Data With Annotations (VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar 431 MB).

Download both files and uncompress them here. There will now be a ``VOCdevkit/`` subdirectory with all the VOC train/test data in it.
